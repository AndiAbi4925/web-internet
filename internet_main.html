            <h1>Let's talk about the internet</h1>
            <p><strong>The Internet</strong> is a massive, global "network of networks" that connects billions of computers, phones, and other devices. It allows them to communicate and share data with each other. How it works: It operates using a set of rules called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). When you send or request data (like loading a webpage), that data is broken into small pieces called packets. Each packet is tagged with its destination and travels independently across the network, passed along by special computers called routers. These packets travel through your local Wi-Fi, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and across a vast infrastructure of physical cables (including massive fiber-optic cables under the ocean) to a server. Once all the packets arrive, your device reassembles them to show you the complete webpage, video, or email.</p>
